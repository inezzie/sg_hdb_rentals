This project looks at the HDB rental prices in Singapore from Jan-2021 to Nov-2024, the entire duration of data available from the government's official open data portal[^2]. This period happens to cover Singapore's Covid-19 response period up till the end of 2024.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Singapore enacted the circuit breaker lockdown period[^3] which enforced stay-at-home measures which included deporting any foreigners found to be in non-compliance with safe distancing measures (e.g. throwing parties in large groups). This, along with majority of the foreign workforce returning to their home countries during the pandemic[^4], led to two possible outcomes for HDB rentals.
1. Rental prices will soar as demand lowers and supply doesn't differ whilst landlords aim to maintain profit.
2. Rental prices will drop as demand lowers and landlords attempt to maintain existing renters from leaving, or to entice new renters.
